	abstract = {This paper discusses the Espressif Systems latest product ESP32 designed for Internet of Things and embedded system related projects. The ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power system on a chip series of microcontrollers with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities and a highly integrated structure powered by a dual-core Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the ESP32 with some other market competitors and introduces the microcontroller specification, features and programming details. A portable, wireless oscilloscope based on the ESP-WROOM-32 and a mobile application is described in detail as an example of successful practical implementation of the device.},

	abstract = {The data center is a signiﬁcant space that serves as a place to store equipment related to the server. Important data must also be safeguarded inside the server room itself, thus security standards are required to safeguard the space, starting with air temperature, humidity, ﬁre disaster prevention, etc. In this paper, the authors propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system that uses MPX5100dp sensor for measuring room pressure, the DHT11 sensor, to detect humidity and temperature, with Node-MCU ESP8266 as the transmitter and microcontroller, and the Blynk application as the MQTT bridge to display the measurements and actuator reactions on mobile phones with Android as the platform. The mechanism on this device can track the temperature of the data center’s room in real time and could run as expected. This has been proven by testing.},

	abstract = {Environmental condition is one of the parameters that cannot be neglected in the measurement or calibration activity in the calibration and testing laboratory, especially when it affects the measurement results. Therefore, according to the ISO/IEC 17025:2017 Clause 6.3.3, laboratory must perform the monitoring, recording, and controlling of the environmental condition to meet its requirement. This paper discusses the development of EGS-PWS (Piston Weather Station) Version 2.0 based on Internet of Things (IoT) application with NodeMCU, MicroPython programming, and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) communication protocol, to perform the data acquisition of environmental condition and automatic temperature control in SNSU-BSN. NodeMCU ESP32 as the node sensor or publisher, in which is integrated with the DHT22, BMP180, and MAX31865 module sensor, is able to read and publish the environmental condition data to the ThingSpeak® as the IoT Platform and MQTT Broker. Meanwhile, the NodeMCU ESP8266 as the subscriber of the "field1"or room temperature topic, is able to control the room temperature automatically with relay module and air condition (AC) remote control as the actuator, without the need of waiting the instruction or command from the user remotely. With the initial room temperature of 25.6 °C, the result shows that the EGS-PWS Version 2.0 is successfully demonstrated to read and publish the environmental condition data to the ThingSpeak channel of the user, able to control the increasing or decreasing room temperature of 1°C in each updated message input in "field1"for a specific time interval, and meet the room temperature requirement of (22 ± 1) °C with 100\% control accuracy in SNSU-BSN. The respond system characteristic shows that the obtained rise time and settling time are 59 minute 19 second and 1 hour 3 minute 27 second, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the EGS-PWS Version 2.0 is possible to be implemented in all of the calibration and testing laboratory. © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Efficient irrigation management is crucial for optimizing water use and productivity in agriculture, particularly in water-scarce regions. This study evaluated the effectiveness of soil-based and weather-based irrigation management using a low-cost (DIY) Internet of Things (IoT) capacitive soil moisture sensor on drip-irrigated lettuce. A field experiment was conducted to compare water productivity and water use efficiency between the two management approaches. The soil-based system utilized real-time data from IoT sensors to guide irrigation scheduling, while the weather-based system relied on evapotranspiration data. The IoT-enabled system used 28.8\% less water and reduced the pumping hours by 16.2\% compared with the conventional weather-based methods. In terms of crop water productivity (CWP), the IoT system reached 16 kg/m3, which was 52.5\% higher than the conventional method (10.5 kg/m3). Furthermore, the developed DIY sensor was compared with existing commercial soil moisture sensors, namely, Teros 54 and Drill\& Drop. The developed prototype demonstrated reliability and accuracy comparable to other commercial sensors, with an R2 = 0.6, validating its utility for enhanced data-driven irrigation, giving its initial low cost (USD 62). These findings highlight the potential of low-cost soil-based IoT systems in enhancing irrigation efficiency and supporting sustainable agriculture, particularly in resource-limited settings.},
